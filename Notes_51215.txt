Animation in MDL

Step 1: Housekeeping
     Look for the Frames command
     Look for the basename command
     Set frames and basename if possible
     Look for vary
     	  Can mandate line 0 and 1 to be frames and basename, but still have
	  to look through the rest of the list to find vary

Step 2:
     Handle each vary command
     Symbol table can only hold one value per knob
     We must build a separate structure for each value
     - Array
       - Each index in the array represents a frame
       - Store a list of knobs and values for that frame
       	 - vary k 0 9 0 1
	 - vary x 3 6 1 0 0

     frame 0	k = 0 	x = 1
     	   1	k = .1	x = 1
	   2	k = .2	x = 1
	   3	k = .3	x = 1
	   4	k = .4	x = .6
	   5	k = .5	x = .3
	   6	k = .6	x = 0
	   7	k = .7	x = 0
	   8	k = .8 	x = 0
	   9	k = .9	x = 0
	   10	k = 1	x = 0

Step 3:
     Generate the image(s)
     If there is no animation code, generate a single image normally
     If there is animation code, loop through commands once per frame
       	Set the value for each knob in the symbol table using the values from step two
	Go through the commands and apply knobs when needed
	Save the frame to a file

   Pass the value of lookup_symbol -> set_value
